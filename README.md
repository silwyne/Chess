# Silwyne Chess

JDK version = 17\
MVN version = 3.9.8

This project is written fully in `Java` with `Java fx`!

I always loved making 2d games, and I think I am starting it making a Chess game.\
I made this project to get better in using `Java fx`.
I wanted to know if Java fx is a good choice for making 2dGames or not.\
And I think the answer of this question is `NO` for 2D games like `Mario` or `Ori`,
but `YES` for games like Chess!

That's why I am going to make my new game in `Java Swing`.

I would keep this project in hand until I complete its AI part. :)

## Running the Application
- Make sure you have all the Dependencies in pom file. `mvn install`
- Install `Java fx` on your System based on if it is Linux or Windows there are different versions.\
guide: I have something like this `javafx-sdk-17.0.11` on my Debian!
- I have this 'vm option' in my build and run configuration.\
`--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-17.0.11/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls`\
That's why I said you have to install `Java fx` :)
- There would be no problem for running this Application anymore!
