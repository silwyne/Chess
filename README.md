### Silwyne Chess
This project is written fully in Java with javafx library.

It now has only one set of pieces but many themes and colors for the board.
At the beginning of the game it ask you to confirm the default theme and style for the board or you can just easily change it.

I hope someday i get a domain name for it as the web version.
or maybe on socket.
or maybe AI improvements.
